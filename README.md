## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to setup the **Weather Dashboard** project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 21 JDK**
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **MySQL** (if used for relational database)
- **Git** (for version control)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/WeatherDashboard.git
cd WeatherDashboard
```

### 3. Configure the Environment

1. Obtain your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Set up the API key and base URL in a configuration file:
   - Open `application.yml` and edit:
     ```yaml
     weather:
       api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
       base-url: https://api.openweathermap.org
     ```

3. Configure database settings in the `application.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/weather_db
       username: your-database-username
       password: your-database-password
     jpa:
       hibernate.ddl-auto: update
   ```

### 4. Build and Run the Application

Use Maven to build and run the project:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
